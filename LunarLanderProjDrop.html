     <p color: #e9e9e9>This project was developed from scratch using openframeworks in C++. The project models were also developed by me.<br> The project incorporates OpenGL shaders and openframeworks lighting, the latter of which is similar to openGL lighting. <br>The Lunar Lander project also included particle effects with physics and emitters along with an octree collision detection<br> algorithm. This project is akin to a remake of the classic 'lunar lander' game which was bundled on atari game consoles<br> in the early years of video game industry. <br>The tech stack for the application is as follows:</p>
